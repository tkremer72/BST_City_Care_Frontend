  <h2>About Thomas & FriendsðŸš‚</h2>

  <p class="about">Four friends all attending Bethel School Of Technology, who took the

    Full Stack Web Developer Program, came together to solve a real-world need. <br>Due to the

    COVID19 Pandemic, communities and people around the country

    have faced an unprecedented lack of the necessities that most people take for granted. <br> Because

    of this pandemic, the team decided that for their final group project, they would focus on those

    needs. During the project proposal phase, the Lord put it on their hearts to create the City Care

    App. The product will be an application that puts the resources in the hands of the community

    and the community in touch with the resources to be able to meet those needs. </p>
